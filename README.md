# OffsideDetection

The Automatic Offside Detection System is a software project designed to automatically detect and analyze offside situations in soccer (football) matches. Offside is a crucial rule in soccer, and accurate detection of offside events can provide valuable insights to players, coaches, and referees for performance analysis and decision-making.
Features
Frame Analysis: The system can process video frames from soccer matches, either in real-time or from pre-recorded footage.
Offside Detection: It employs computer vision techniques to detect players' positions on the field and identify potential offside situations.
Visualization: The system can provide visual overlays on the video feed to highlight offside situations, making it easier for users to understand the detected events.

This project is in the works.
